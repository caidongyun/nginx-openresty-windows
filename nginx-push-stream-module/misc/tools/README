These tools, publisher and subscriber, were developed only to do some load tests on push stream module.
Their use is very restricted and is not intended to cover all possible configuration for the module.
The first version was developed by Michael Costello and I made some improvements to distribute it.
Feel free to help continuous improvement.

Any feedbacks will be welcome.

=============
Requirements:
=============

lib argtable2
GCC, make, the usual guys
epoll event support

================
Developer Guide:
================

The basic configuration used on the load tests are listed bellow.
To compile the tools only execute a make.

To see all options use:
  ./publisher --help
  ./subscriber --help

Pay attention on default values to run your tests.
